# Evidence for TBR-RF-03

**Trade:** Access point and mesh radio consolidation

**Trade file:** `docs/trades/TBR-RF-03-access-point-and-mesh-radio-consolidation.md`

**Priority:** 4 of 16 (SAD v0.31 section 30.2). **Function owner:** Network + RF.
**Named owner:** `TBD-SRR`.

**Current contents:** none. This trade is `OPEN` and no evidence has been
produced.

This directory exists before the work does, deliberately. The closure gate is
written in the trade file before evidence is gathered, so the result cannot be
graded against a standard invented after seeing it.

## What belongs here

Read the **Closure evidence** and **Closure gate** sections of the trade file
named above. Those sections are transcribed from the SAD and are authoritative;
this file does not restate them, so that the two cannot drift apart.

Every artifact follows the naming and recording rules in
`docs/evidence/README.md`:

- `YYYY-MM-DD-<what>-<node-or-configuration>.<ext>`
- Measurements record instrument, date, node, image build, configuration,
  ambient conditions, and who took them.
- Vendor datasheets go in `datasheets/` with a `.SOURCE.md` recording the
  URL, retrieval date, and document revision. Archive them when you cite them;
  vendors delete PDFs. SAD section 34 is the program's external source register.
- Nothing real: no deployment location, member identity, callsign, credential,
  or operational capture. Strip photograph metadata. See `SECURITY.md`.

**Requires hardware:** Requires at least two nodes and several client devices. The prototype BOM gates

## Closing

Evidence here is necessary and not sufficient. SAD section 30.2: a TBR closes
only when its listed evidence exists, **the named owner accepts the evidence**,
and the resulting architecture decision is entered into the persistent ADR
register.

Closing a trade whose named owner is still `TBD-SRR` is not possible, because
there is nobody to accept the evidence.
